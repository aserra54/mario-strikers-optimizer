# MSBL Build Optimizer

This repository contains scripts for optimizing player builds in Mario Strikers: Battle League for the Nintendo
Switch. The repository is somewhat messy as this was never really meant to be consumed by anyone, but it contains a
decent foundation for people to use.

## Motivation

My son and I enjoy playing MSBL together as a hobby, but given his young age and limited understanding of the game in
general, it sometimes isn't easy for him to actually score goals. As such, I wrote these scripts to optimize some of
his favorite players (e.g. Bowser, Birdo) to min-max their statistics to make it easier for him to score.

The best results for my son thus far have been Birdo, using a Trick-Bushido-Knight-Cannon setup, giving her a stat
spread of 10-7-20-2-24. This is great because my son can execute charge shots fairly easily, so the high shooting and
technique make it easy for him to score goals while standing still. Since my son never passes the ball, dumping
passing to 2 made sense, and the remainder was me trying to balance speed and tackling based on his preferences (he
likes tackling everyone, might as well make him decent at it).

Another good build was Bowser, using Trick-Knight-Knight-Cannon for a spread of 21-8-21-3-10. It's similar to Birdo's
build, but with technique swapped for strength. The rationale was the same, except when he feels like tackling people
more than scoring, I let him use this build instead.
